Scenario 1:
tx {
    Bean1 -> getConnection -> insert data into table -> call bean2 -> close connection
    Bean2 -> getConnection -> update above data -> close connection
}

tx {
    Bean1 -> new transaction query that data indeed got updated
}
---

Scenario 2:
tx {
    Bean1 -> getConnection -> insert data into table -> close connection -> call bean2
    Bean2 -> getConnection -> update above data --> close connection
}

tx {
    Bean1 -> new transaction query that data indeed got updated
}
---

Scenario 3:
tx {
    Bean1 -> getConnection:c1  -> insert data into table -> getConnection:c2
    -> insert some more data -> call bean2 -> close c1, c2
    Bean2 -> getConnection -> update above data --> close connection
}

tx {
    Bean1 -> new transaction query that data indeed got updated
}
---

Scenario 4:
tx {
    Bean1 -> getConnection:c1  -> insert data into table -> getConnection:c2
    -> insert some more data -> close c1,c2 -> call bean2
    Bean2 -> getConnection -> update above data --> close connection
}

tx {
    Bean1 -> new transaction query that data indeed got updated
}

Scenario 5:

This test opens 4 connections, and closes the connections in another
order than the connections are opened (which you would not do anymore 
when using try with resources).

It is expected that all 4 connections are using the same 1 physical 
connection to the database. This test depends on the equals method of 
the Connection interface implementation.

---

Scenario 6:

This test is about using 2 datasources and about the connection pool size. 
A 100 bean calls are made in the same transaction, default connection pool 
size is 32.

Expecting that the implementation reuses connections,
while code runs in the same transaction.

Expecting that getting a resource from a second datasource is possible,
while code runs in the same transaction.

The pool size in datasource: "jdbc-connsharing-pool" is not
initialized with a certain max pool size. Thus default "max-pool-size" in
public class ConnectionPool is set to 32 connections.

Calling the second bean, while first conn1 connection is still open
should be possible, and should not lead to pool problems. 
The connection pool maximum should not be reached in this test.

Scenario 7:

Adding a test-case (test7 in EJB) for GlassFish-Issue : 15443
Two resource-refs (in this case @Resource injections) for same resource
and doing a physical lookup of same resource (initialContext.lookup), which was failing.
Fix for 15443 should make this test pass.

---

Scenario 8:

Adding a test-case (test8 in EJB) for GlassFish-Issue : 15577 or 15586
Two resources from two different pools (each one with different database, assoc-with-thread=true)
to make sure that connections from appropriate pool is retrieved from the thread-local.

---

Scenario 9:

Call code that resembles issue 24805 situations: the connection pool might contain
resources that are marked as enlisted in a transaction, and should not be handed out
from the pool. If it would be handed out, it could end up in another transaction where
it would not be enlisted and in the end closing the connection would fail because 
the closeResouce logic has no transaction associated.
This test only tests a single thread, to ensure the enlisted state is correct when a 
resource is returned from the connection pool. 

This tests asks a Singleton utility bean for a database Connection from a @Datasource,
Then the connection is used and while it is in use another few connections are requested
from the pool using the same Singleton. The connection pool should not return a 
ResourceHandle that has the state enlisted.

It could be argued that the Singleton utility class should not return a Connection, but 
the utility method is marked as Transaction SUPPORTS, and it allows a codebase to only define
1 location where @Resource is located, plus it allows adding connection statistics and validations
inside this 1 location. Instead of replicating this all over the codebase in a large system. 

Running this test should not lead to enlisted status validation checks like:
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Resource may not be marked enlisted! handle: 
<ResourceHandle id=2, state=<ResourceState enlisted=true, busy=true/>/>
	at com.sun.enterprise.resource.pool.ConnectionPool.getUnenlistedResource(ConnectionPool.java)
